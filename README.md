# Mission Control

A [Sessen](https://github.com/ElizabethF2/Sessen) extension that enables applications to be proxied and jobs to be launched via a hosted message bus service as a means of NAT traversal.

This repo is also the home of the Mission Control Bus which is used as a relay by both [Mission Control Lite](https://github.com/ElizabethF2/MissionControlLite) and [CharonRMM](https://github.com/ElizabethF2/CharonRMM).
